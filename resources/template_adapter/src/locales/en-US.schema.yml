      maxContextRatio: Maximum context usage ratio (0~1). Controls the maximum percentage of the model context window that can be used. For example, 0.35 means up to 35% of the model context.
      temperature: Degree of randomness in responses. Higher values result in more random responses.
      presencePenalty: Presence penalty coefficient. Higher values reduce the likelihood of repeating tokens that have appeared at least once (range 0~2, step 0.1).
      frequencyPenalty: Frequency penalty coefficient. Higher values reduce the likelihood of frequently appearing tokens (range 0~2, step 0.1).
